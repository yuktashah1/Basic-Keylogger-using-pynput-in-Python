This keylogger program utilizes the pynput library to monitor keyboard input. Each keystroke is recorded and processed, and special keys such as space, enter, backspace, shift, control, alt, command, delete, and caps lock are appropriately handled. The recorded keystrokes are then saved to a file named "keylog.txt".
